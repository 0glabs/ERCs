# [ERC-XXXX] CHONK9K Token Standard

**Author:** BoomchainLabs  
**Status:** Draft  
**Type:** Standards Track (ERC)  
**Created:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Category:** ERC  
**Requires:** ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155  

---

## Abstract

The **CHONK9K Token (ERC-XXXX)** extends ERC-20 by integrating **NFT staking, play-to-earn rewards, and cross-chain interoperability**. The objective is to create a **community-driven meme token** that drives liquidity, incentivizes holders, and catalyzes gaming and NFT adoption across multiple blockchain networks.

---

## Motivation

Traditional meme tokens often lack sustainable mechanisms beyond speculation. CHONK9K introduces:
- **NFT Staking:** Holders can stake CHONK9K NFTs to earn token rewards.
- **Play-to-Earn Rewards:** The token fuels blockchain-based gaming incentives, integrating seamlessly with metaverse projects.
- **Cross-Chain Bridging:** Native interoperability between Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and Solana.
- **Deflationary Tokenomics:** Features such as auto-burn and reflections ensure a sustainable token economy.

These features combine to create a multi-faceted ecosystem that enhances DeFi, gaming, and NFT integrations.

---

## Specification

### 1. Token Mechanics

CHONK9K adheres to the ERC-20 standard while extending functionality with:
- **Reflections:** A percentage of each transaction is redistributed to token holders.
- **Auto-Burn:** A portion of tokens is permanently removed, reducing total supply over time.
- **Governance Voting:** Token holders can participate in decision-making via on-chain proposals.

### 2. NFT Staking (ERC-721 & ERC-1155)

- **Mechanism:** Users stake CHONK9K NFTs to earn additional token rewards.
- **Rewards:** Distribution is based on NFT rarity and staking duration.
- **Efficiency:** The smart contract is optimized for gas usage during staking and reward distribution.

### 3. Play-to-Earn Integration

- **In-Game Currency:** CHONK9K is used as the primary currency in supported blockchain games.
- **Reward Pools:** Developers can integrate staking pools that distribute CHONK9K as in-game rewards.
- **Interoperability:** Supports NFT-based in-game assets to bolster ecosystem engagement.

### 4. Cross-Chain Bridging

- **Bridging Mechanism:** Facilitates token transfers across Ethereum, BSC, and Solana.
- **Protocols:** Leverages established bridge providers such as Celer, Wormhole, or LayerZero for secure transfers.
- **Liquidity Enhancement:** Enables multi-chain liquidity pools to expand adoption.

## Contract Interface (Solidity Example)

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface ICHONK9K {
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);
    function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);

    // Additional Features
    function burn(uint256 amount) external;
    function claimRewards() external;
    function stakeNFT(uint256 tokenId) external;
    function unstakeNFT(uint256 tokenId) external;
    function bridgeTokens(uint256 amount, string memory targetChain) external;

    event Burn(address indexed account, uint256 amount);
    event RewardsClaimed(address indexed account, uint256 amount);
    event NFTStaked(address indexed staker, uint256 tokenId);
    event NFTUnstaked(address indexed staker, uint256 tokenId);
    event BridgeTransfer(address indexed user, uint256 amount, string targetChain);
}
```

## Rationale

The **CHONK9K Token Standard** is engineered for sustainable growth and innovation by:
- **Enhancing Tokenomics:** Integrating deflationary mechanisms such as auto-burn and reflections.
- **Driving Engagement:** Encouraging long-term participation through NFT staking and play-to-earn rewards.
- **Ensuring Scalability:** Enabling cross-chain functionality to facilitate liquidity and market reach.
- **Securing Ecosystem:** Implementing robust governance and security practices aligned with industry standards.

---

## Backwards Compatibility

- **ERC-20 Compliance:** Fully compatible with existing wallets and exchanges.
- **NFT Integration:** Uses ERC-721 & ERC-1155 standards for NFT staking mechanisms.
- **Interoperability:** Bridge protocols ensure seamless interaction across Ethereum, BSC, and Solana networks.

---

## Security Considerations

- **Reentrancy Protection:** Utilizes OpenZeppelin libraries for secure contract interactions.
- **Gas Optimization:** Streamlined staking and bridging logic to minimize transaction costs.
- **Bridge Security:** Adopts trusted third-party validators to secure cross-chain token transfers.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Community Review & Feedback:** Engage with the Ethereum community for input.
2. **Testing:** Deploy on Ethereum testnets (e.g., Goerli, Sepolia) for thorough validation.
3. **Submission:** Prepare a Pull Request to the official Ethereum EIPs repository for final approval.
